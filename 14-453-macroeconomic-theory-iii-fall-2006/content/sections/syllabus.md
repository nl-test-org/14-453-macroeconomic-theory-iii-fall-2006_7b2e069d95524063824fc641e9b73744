Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Requirements
-------------------

Problem sets are an integral part of the course. You are encouraged to work on the problem sets in groups but you must turn in your own individual work. You have one week to turn in each problem set. TA sessions will be devoted to the solution of the previous week's problem set and some extra material not covered in the lectures.

Grading
-------

The final grade will be a weighted average of the problems sets and the final exam. The final exam will be during the time of our last scheduled class.
